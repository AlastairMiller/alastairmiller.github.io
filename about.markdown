Professionally I am a DevOps engineer, previously being a backend software engineer. 
Given this background I am an advocate for GitOps, providing repeatable, source controlled and more collaborative approach to creating infrastructure.
Personal interests include defence, cloud computing and cyber security so most articles will revolve around these articles.
I prefer to produce guides rather then to commit to maintaining libraries or plugins so hopefully you find some of what you read informative.

Alastair.
